Credit Card Validation

Tools for working with a house of (credit) cards.

Usage
-----

It's as simple as:

```
editText.addTextChangedListener(new CreditCardTextWatcher());
```

You can also pass in your own instance of `CreditCardUtil` to control what card types are used:

```
CreditCardUtil cardUtil = new CreditCardUtil(CreditCardUtil.VISA);
editText.addTextChangedListener(new CreditCardTextWatcher(cardUtil));
```

And you're not just limited to built in types! Just implement `CreditCard`!
